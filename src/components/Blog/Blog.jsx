                    <p className='text-xl mt-4'> Controlled components refer to components that have their state and behavior controlled by the parent component. These components rely on props passed down from the parent component to update their state and behavior. Uncontrolled components refer to components that manage their own state internally.</p>

                    <p className='text-xl mt-4'>PropTypes are simply a mechanism that ensures that the passed value is of the correct datatype. This makes sure that we donâ€™t receive an error at the very end of our app by the console which might not be easy to deal with.</p>

                    <p className='text-xl mt-4'>NodeJS is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model using JavaScript as its main language. It helps to build scalable network applications. Express is a minimal and flexible Node. js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.</p>

                    <p className='text-xl mt-4'>Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic  but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated. How does a custom Hook get isolated state? Each call to a Hook gets isolated state.</p>
