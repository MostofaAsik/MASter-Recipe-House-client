                <p className='text-xl mt-4'> Controlled components refer to components that have their state and behavior controlled by the parent component.

                <p className='text-xl mt-4'>Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic  but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated. How does a custom Hook get isolated state? Each call to a Hook gets isolated state.</p>
